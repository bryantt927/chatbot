#//server.domain.edu:certfile=/etc/path/to/your/cert.crt  # Path to your certificate file

# Strict SSL (recommended for production)

# Other useful settings (optional, but good practice)
# Save exact (prevents accidental upgrades):
save-exact=true

# Set loglevel to 'error' to reduce output during normal operations
loglevel=error
